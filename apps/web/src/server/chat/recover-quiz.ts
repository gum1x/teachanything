/**
 * Recover a quiz a model emitted as text instead of a native `showQuiz` tool
 * call.
 *
 * Note the placeholder behaviour, which is what the reporting professor actually
 * experienced: buffering the leak means nothing reaches the screen between the
 * model's preamble ("Here are 5 multiple-choice questions:") and the finished
 * widget. On Llama 4 Maverick that gap averaged 59s and peaked at 172s, so the
 * quiz read as a dead stream and users gave up before it arrived. Once the held
 * text is unmistakably a quiz being written, a `tool-input-start` is emitted so
 * the existing `QuizSkeleton` ("Building your quiz...") fills the gap, exactly as
 * it already does for a native streamed tool call.
 *
 * Some otherwise tool-capable models (varies by model/provider) serialize the
 * tool call into the assistant *text* channel, so the AI SDK forms no
 * `tool-showQuiz` part and the raw call renders as prose. The leak can be the
 * whole text block or -- as seen in production -- follow a sentence of preamble
 * ("Here are some quiz questions...") inside the same block, and it can be
 * either JSON or pseudo-call syntax (see `parseQuizFromText`).
 *
 * So this watches each text block for a leak marker, holding back only the few
 * characters that could be an incomplete marker. Once a marker appears, the
 * text from that point is held; if it parses to a renderable quiz the held text
 * is dropped and replaced with a synthetic `tool-input-available` chunk --
 * identical to a native call, so it renders as the interactive widget and
 * persists like one. Any preamble before the marker is kept as text; a held
 * block that turns out not to be a quiz is emitted unchanged.
 *
 * Ordinary prose keeps streaming token by token: text is only withheld from a
 * marker onward, and `stillPlausible` releases it again as soon as the shape
 * rules a quiz out.
 *
 * Accepted limitation: when a block holds a non-quiz JSON blob (or fence) AND a
 * real leak after it, recovery drops everything from the first marker on, so the
 * intervening content is lost with the leak. A quiz turn that also contains an
 * unrelated JSON blob isn't a shape worth the extra state.
