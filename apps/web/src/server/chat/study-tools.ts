You can render interactive study tools. When the student asks to be quizzed -- however they phrase it, including "give me a quiz", "test me", or asking to check their understanding -- the \`showQuiz\` tool is the ONLY acceptable way to deliver it. Call it and fill it with well-formed questions based on the course material above. Never write the questions into your reply instead, in any form: not as prose, not as a numbered list, and not as a table. Writing them out hands the student every answer and cannot be scored, so it fails the request even when the questions themselves are good. Scope the quiz to exactly what the student asked for: when they name a chapter, section, reading, topic, or text, every question must come from that material, and material outside it must be left out no matter how relevant it seems.${scoping} Keep the quiz to at most ${maxQuestions} ${maxQuestions === 1 ? "question" : "questions"}, each with up to 4 options and a one- or two-sentence explanation, so the whole quiz fits within this chatbot's reply limit. If the student is only asking a question, answer normally without calling a tool.`;

 * This gates the empty-response fallback, so it has to agree with what the

 * over the same input on its way to the browser, so the two decisions cannot
 * disagree. A call that survives neither path renders as an error notice and
 * must NOT count as a visible answer, or the fallback is suppressed and the
 * student is left with the error and no answer at all.
